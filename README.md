* When I open the menu toggle, I want to add a feature that when you click anywhere on the screen other than a menu button, it closes the drop down.
* Don't know if this is that important though.
* Maybe need to improve background visuals.
* Add fade in on load up and add fade in when navigating to new page.
* Change portrait photo background? Or maybe keep red but add more red to website?
* Need to change first introduction photo to something else.

* Page 3: Large h1 title at top of each card. Then small text stating languages slightly below html css js. Short explanation. Then link 
to github page / possibly even a hosted website version but that seems excessive. Best is to just add those gifs to start of my 
github repo.



* z index is fixed for navbar.
