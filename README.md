* When I open the menu toggle, I want to add a feature that when you click anywhere on the screen other than a menu button, it closes the drop down.

* Add fade in on load up and add fade in when navigating to new page.
* Change portrait photo background? Or maybe keep red but add more red to website?
* Need to change first introduction photo to something else.

* Page 3: Large h1 title at top of each card. Then small text stating languages slightly below html css js. Short explanation. Then link

github repo.
