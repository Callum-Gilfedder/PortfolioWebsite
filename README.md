* When I open the menu toggle, I want to add a feature that when you click anywhere on the screen other than a menu button, it closes the drop down.
* Don't know if this is that important though.
* Maybe need to improve background visuals.
* Add fade in on load up and add fade in when navigating to new page.
* Change portrait photo background?
* Need to change first introduction photo to something else.
* z index is fixed for navbar.

* Maybe remove all photos of myself?


* Fix github link undoing hover animation for card.
* Could fix this by adding hover event listener to every single element of the card? Alot of effort but may be only solution.
* Add favicon.

* Could improve paragraph formats when actually adding correct text.
* Add a footer maybe?
* Maybe add a very faint textured background to my website to add texture.
* Definately need to improve responsiveness. Not good enough at the minute.

* Upload disseratation code to github and add gif displaying a simulation I did at some point.

* Add load up animations!!!! Think this could really improve visuals of sight. Think the website needs a few little tweaks to really
make it pop visually.

* when <600px menu overlaps with website content. Fix.

* Links section on page 4 doesn't look quite right with the buttons. Maybe redo this section.

* Figured out how to do a hover affect but it doesn't work for light mode. Also doesn't look amazing yet. Maybe rethink this. Don't include 
just because it was difficult to implement.

* Added grey background images but it might be too grey now. Maybe revert back.

* Page 4 links working.

* Need to do responsive overhaul.
